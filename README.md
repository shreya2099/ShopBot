AI bot for generating captions
Image Captioning Using CNN and LSTM
Caption generation is a challenging artificial intelligence problem where a textual description must be generated for a given photograph.

It requires both methods from computer vision to understand the content of the image and a language model from the field of natural language processing to turn the understanding of the image into words in the right order. Recently, deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art results on examples of this problem.

Deep learning methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art results on caption generation problems. What is most impressive about these methods is a single end-to-end model can be defined to predict a caption, given a photo, instead of requiring sophisticated data preparation or a pipeline of specifically designed models.
